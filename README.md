# my first neural network!
this is my first attempt at creating my own neural network!\
uses no existing neural net libraries, (such as Tensorflow, pytorch, etc)\
only numpy for vector/matrix multiplcation.\
[trained using the MNIST database](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)\
mnist_loader.py taken from [here](https://github.com/unexploredtest/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) to simplify loading in the training data\
painter.py was mostly written by chatGPT... I just wanted a neat canvas!
I wrote network.py

to run it, just run painter.py (ie:)
`python painter.py`
